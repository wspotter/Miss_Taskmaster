# Miss_TaskMaster Implementation Progress Notes

## Current Status
- **Date:** September 9, 2025
- **Progress:** Phase 8.6.1 (Package Extension) - In Progress
- **Issue:** VSCode extension packaging failing due to missing repository field in package.json. Need to add repository or use --allow-missing-repository flag.

## Completed Tasks
- Phase 7: Project Setup and Core Utilities (All tasks completed)
  - Project repository initialized
  - Python environment set up with openai, pydantic
  - Logging configuration implemented
  - Session manager implemented
  - Task enforcer implemented
  - LLM guard implemented
  - Gatekeeper agent implemented
  - Coding agent implemented
  - Main entry point created
  - Project plan template created
- Phase 8.1: VSCode Extension Development (Tasks 8.1.1-8.1.5 completed)
  - Extension project initialized with TypeScript
  - Core extension files implemented (extension.ts, package.json, tsconfig.json)
  - Basic commands added (initProject, runOrchestration, showProjectPlan)
  - Project plan webview created
  - Task status tree view implemented
- Phase 8.6: Packaging (Task 8.6.1 in progress)

## Next Steps
1. **Resolve Packaging Issue:** Add repository field to vscode_extension/package.json or use --allow-missing-repository flag with vsce package.
2. **Task 8.6.2:** Test extension installation from .vsix file.
3. **Phase 9:** Implement MCP Server
   - Initialize FastAPI project
   - Integrate SuperManUS core
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Add CORS
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Orchestration with Docker Compose
   - Client integration examples

## Key Files and Structure
- `/src/supermanus/`: Core Python modules (gatekeeper_agent.py, coding_agent.py, etc.)
- `/vscode_extension/`: VSCode extension source
- `/main.py`: CLI entry point
- `/project_plan_template.json`: Sample project plan
- `/requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Notes for Next LLM
- The project is set up with a virtual environment in `venv/`.
- Activate with `source venv/bin/activate` before running Python code.
- The VSCode extension is compiled to `vscode_extension/out/`.
- Use `npx @vscode/vsce package --allow-missing-repository` to package the extension.
- All changes are committed to git with descriptive messages.
- Follow the design document for implementation details.

## Auto Agent Mode
This implementation is being done in auto agent mode, following the detailed plan from the multi_agent_system_design.md document. Continue incrementally, committing after each logical task completion.
